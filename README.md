# Montgomery-Crime-Data-Analysis


FINDINGS

The highest percentage of crimes between 2017 and 2022 was committed against property, accounting for the largest number of crimes. There has been a decline in the number of crimes and the number of victims since the year 2019 and this can be seen in the first visualization. There is a relatively similar distribution of crime in Montgomery between 2017 and 2022 when comparing the two years. A comparison of the distribution of crimes across the police district shows that property crime takes the largest share of all crimes committed. It has also been revealed from our analysis above that out of all the cities in Montgomery, Silver Spring stands out as the one that dominates when it comes to crime rates. Based on an analysis of the place of crime found in each category of crime through 2020 and 2022, crimes committed in schools - elementary and secondary - resulted in more victims.


CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

A look at the statistics showed that the most crimes were committed near residential places and a significant increase in “school- elementary/secc”, and the least crimes were committed near places like “bars” and “clubs”, we would recommend a shift to look at these places and increase the number of police district and possibly increase in response time to crimes. With visual representation, it does seem clear that “crime against property” that comprises of “ROBERY” and most importantly “ROBERY- STREET - GUN” is the most common type of crime. It would be wise for Montgomery authorities to take a closer look at this type of crime since it is the most prolific. We would recommend a closer look at “Guns control” in the state of Maryland. Based on the information presented above, it seems that Silver Spring is the city that has the highest crime rate and additionally, an analysis of the weekly crime data shows that the highest crimes are committed on Friday, which is the start of the weekend, and the lowest crimes are committed on Sundays.
